# Changelog

All notable changes to Mini Diarium are documented here. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.3] — 01-03-2026

### Added

- **Expanded rich text toolbar**: heading selector (Normal / H1 / H2 / H3), Underline, Strikethrough, Blockquote, Inline Code, and Horizontal Rule buttons added to the editor toolbar. Markdown export now correctly converts strikethrough (`~~`), blockquotes (`>`), inline code (`` ` ``), and fenced code blocks (` ``` `).
- **Minimal toolbar by default**: a new **Show advanced formatting toolbar** preference (Preferences → Writing) controls whether the extended toolbar controls are visible. The default is off — the toolbar shows only Bold, Italic, Bullet List, and Ordered List. Toggling the setting on reveals the full toolbar (headings, Underline, Strikethrough, Blockquote, Inline Code, Horizontal Rule) immediately without restarting. Rendering of existing content and import/export behavior are unaffected by this setting.
- **Configurable auto-lock timeout**: a new **Auto-Lock** section in Preferences → Security lets you enable automatic locking after a period of inactivity. When enabled, any mouse movement, key press, click, touch, or scroll resets the idle timer; the diary locks automatically once the timeout (1–999 seconds, default 300) expires with no activity. The setting is stored in `localStorage` and takes effect immediately without restarting.
- **Auto-lock on macOS screen lock**: the diary now auto-locks when the display sleeps, the system enters sleep, or the user explicitly locks the screen (Cmd+Ctrl+Q / Apple menu → Lock Screen) on macOS. Uses `NSWorkspaceScreensDidSleepNotification`, `NSWorkspaceWillSleepNotification`, and `com.apple.screenIsLocked` via `NSDistributedNotificationCenter`.
- **Multiple entries per day**: each diary day can now hold any number of independent entries. A `←` / `→` navigation bar appears above the editor when a day has more than one entry, showing the current position (e.g. `2 / 3`). A `+` button on the right side of the bar creates a new blank entry for the same date. Single-entry days look and behave exactly as before — the navigation bar is hidden.
- **Entry identity**: each entry now carries a stable `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` id. Saves, deletes, and exports all reference entries by id rather than by date.

### Changed

- **Database schema bumped to v5**: the `entries` table gains an `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` column; the old `date TEXT PRIMARY KEY` unique constraint is replaced by a non-unique `idx_entries_date` index. Existing databases are migrated automatically on first launch (entries are preserved in date-creation order).
- **Import no longer merges same-date entries**: previously, importing a file with entries that matched an existing date would merge the content. Imports now always create a new entry, consistent with the multiple-entries-per-day model. The `entries_merged` field has been removed from the import result.
- **JSON export format changed to an array**: the exported JSON file now contains an `"entries"` array (each object includes an `"id"` field) instead of a date-keyed object. This format can represent multiple entries per day correctly. The `"metadata"` wrapper (`application`, `version`, `exportedAt`) is unchanged.
- **Markdown export groups multiple entries per day**: when a day has more than one entry, each entry appears as a `### Entry N` sub-heading (or `### {title}` if the entry has a title) under the day's `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading.

### Fixed

- **Streak calculation now counts distinct days**: with multiple entries per date, the statistics streak algorithm now deduplicates dates before computing streaks, ensuring one active day is counted once regardless of how many entries it contains.

## [0.4.2] — 28-02-2026

### Added

- **Journal Picker as the outermost app layer**: the app now opens to a **Journal Picker** screen before any diary authentication. The picker lists all configured journals and lets you open, rename, or remove any of them without authenticating first. You can also create a new diary (picks a folder, names it, then goes to password creation) or open an existing `diary.db` from any folder — both flows that were previously fragmented across the first-launch screen and Preferences > Journals. On a shared device, each person can select their own diary without having to step through someone else's lock screen.
- **"← Back to Journals" link** on both `PasswordCreation` and `PasswordPrompt` screens, letting users navigate back to the journal picker without locking or restarting the app.
- **Removing the last journal is now allowed**: the backend no longer blocks removal of the sole remaining journal; the picker simply shows the empty state with the two Add buttons so the user can configure a new one.

### Changed

- **Journal management moved to the Journal Picker**: the **Journals** tab has been removed from Preferences. All journal operations (add, rename, remove, open) are available on the pre-auth picker screen. Auth methods, password changes, and data settings remain in their respective Preferences tabs unchanged.
- **Auth flow**: `initializeAuth()` now always routes to `'journal-select'` on startup (instead of probing the diary path immediately); `refreshAuthState()` is called only after the user selects a journal. This eliminates the single-user assumption baked into the previous startup sequence.
- **Release build profile**: added `[profile.release]` with `opt-level = 3` and `lto = true` to `Cargo.toml` for smaller, faster distribution binaries.
- **Website SEO/GEO refresh (2026)**: upgraded metadata and machine-readable signals for search and AI retrieval. Added robots snippet controls, richer Open Graph/Twitter tags (`og:site_name`, `og:locale`, image dimensions, account attribution), expanded JSON-LD graph (`SoftwareApplication` + `Organization` + `WebSite` + `FAQPage` with `softwareVersion`/`dateModified`), added extraction-friendly **Quick facts** + **FAQ** sections, introduced a dedicated **Release status** block with explicit last-updated date, replaced placeholder `href="#"` links, updated sitemap to use `<lastmod>`, and added a lightweight social preview asset (`website/assets/og-cover.svg`).
- **Website compatibility and cache hardening (2026-02-26)**: added a broader favicon set (`favicon.ico`, 16/32/128 PNG, `apple-touch-icon`), published `ai-crawlers.txt` and `llms.txt` with footer/README discoverability, and introduced content-hash fingerprinting for website CSS/JS (`website:fingerprint`) so nginx can safely keep `immutable` only for hashed assets while unfingerprinted files use short TTL caching.

## [0.4.1] — 25-02-2026

### Added

- **ESC key can now quit the app** (#25): a new "ESC key action" preference (General tab) lets you choose between _Do nothing_ (default, unchanged behaviour) and _Quit the app_. When set to Quit, pressing Escape anywhere on the main screen closes the application — identical to clicking the title-bar X button, so the autosave `beforeunload` handler fires normally. The shortcut is suppressed whenever any dialog is open, so Escape still dismisses overlays as before.
- **Preferences panel reorganised into tabs**: the single long-scroll preferences dialog is now a sidebar-tab layout with five tabs — **General** (theme, ESC action), **Writing** (calendar and editor options), **Journals** (journal management), **Security** (auth methods, change password), and **Data** (diary path, move location, reset). Writing and Security tabs are grayed out and non-clickable while the diary is locked.
- **Sidebar starts collapsed on launch and unlock** (#24): the app now opens directly to today's entry without the calendar panel obscuring the editor. The sidebar can still be toggled via the menu button. After locking and unlocking, the view resets to today's entry with the sidebar closed.
- **Window size and position are remembered between sessions** (#26): the app restores the window dimensions and position from the previous session. First launch still uses the default 800×660 px. Powered by `tauri-plugin-window-state`.
- **Official user-plugin example and guides**: added `docs/user-plugins/plain-text-timeline.rhai` as a reference Rhai export plugin, plus dedicated built-in/user plugin guides for requirements, testing, and best practices.

### Changed

- **Plugin documentation structure simplified**: user plugin documentation and canonical example now live together in `docs/user-plugins/` for discoverability; README now links to this area from a dedicated **Extending Mini Diarium** section.
- **E2E test isolation hardened**: `bun run test:e2e` now runs in deterministic clean-room mode (isolated diary data, isolated WebView profile on Windows, fixed 800×660 viewport, and backend window-state persistence disabled via `MINI_DIARIUM_E2E=1`), with `bun run test:e2e:stateful` available for persistence-focused checks in a repo-local state directory.


## [0.4.0] - 25-02-2026

### Added

- **Extension system for import/export formats**: built-in formats (Mini Diary JSON, Day One JSON, Day One TXT, jrnl JSON, JSON export, Markdown export) are now served through a unified plugin registry. Users can add custom import/export formats by dropping `.rhai` scripts into a `plugins/` folder inside their diary directory. Rhai scripts run in a secure sandbox (no file system, no network, operation limits enforced). A `README.md` with templates and API docs is auto-generated in the `plugins/` folder on first launch.
- **Multiple journals**: configure and switch between multiple journals (e.g. personal, work, travel) from the login screen. A dropdown selector appears on the password/key-file unlock screen when more than one journal is configured. Journals are managed in Preferences (add, rename, remove, switch). Each journal is an independent encrypted `diary.db` in its own directory. Existing single-diary setups are automatically migrated — no action required. The "Change Location" feature in Preferences stays in sync with the active journal's config.

### Fixed

- **Navigating to an empty date no longer creates a spurious calendar dot**: clicking into the editor on a date with no entry (without typing anything, or typing only whitespace) previously wrote an empty entry to the database because TipTap normalises an empty document to `<p></p>`, which bypassed the `!content.trim()` check. The save logic now uses TipTap's `editor.isEmpty || editor.getText().trim() === ''` to correctly identify empty and whitespace-only content, and passes `''` to the backend deletion guard so it also passes. Fixes #22.
- **Keyboard shortcuts overhauled**: bracket-key accelerators (`CmdOrCtrl+[`/`]` for previous/next day, `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+[`/`]` for previous/next month) replace the old arrow-key combos that conflicted with OS and TipTap text-navigation bindings. Removed the duplicate frontend `keydown` listener (`shortcuts.ts`) that caused every shortcut to fire twice. Removed accelerators from Statistics, Import, and Export that conflicted with TipTap italic (`Ctrl+I`) and Chromium DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`). All shortcut definitions now live exclusively in `menu.rs` as OS-level menu accelerators.
- **CI diagram verification now detects stale outputs**: the "Verify diagrams are up-to-date" workflow step now compares each regenerated `*-check.svg` file with its committed SVG counterpart and fails with a clear remediation message when any diagram differs.
- **Flaky diagram CI diffs resolved**: diagram rendering/checking is now centralized in `scripts/render-diagrams.mjs` and `scripts/verify-diagrams.mjs`; Mermaid always renders with a consistent Puppeteer config in both local and CI runs; CI uses `bun run diagrams:check` (project-locked Mermaid CLI instead of `bun x mmdc`), workflow Bun installs now use `--frozen-lockfile`, Bun is pinned to `1.2`, and D2 is pinned/validated at `v0.7.1` to prevent toolchain drift.
- **Editor now scales better on large/fullscreen windows**: the main writing column keeps the existing compact behavior on smaller screens, but expands its max width on larger displays and increases the editor's default writing area height on tall viewports to reduce unused space below the editor.
- **Session state is now fully reset on lock/logout boundaries**: locking the diary (manual lock button or backend-emitted `diary-locked` event from OS/session auto-lock flows) now clears transient frontend state so selected date, in-memory entry/search state, and open overlays do not leak across sessions or journal switches. Unlock now starts from a fresh `today` baseline; E2E coverage was updated accordingly.
- **Journal selection on auth screens no longer reverts to the previous journal**: switching journals from the locked/no-diary screen now updates auth status without reloading journal metadata in the same step, preventing the dropdown from briefly changing and then snapping back to the old journal.
- **Auth screens no longer clip content when multiple journals are configured**: the journal selector dropdown added in 0.4.0 pushed the unlock/create-diary cards past the 600 px window height, causing the top of the card to be clipped with no way to scroll. The layout now uses a column-flex + `my-auto` pattern so the card centres when space is available and the page scrolls naturally when it is not. Outer vertical padding was reduced (`py-12` → `py-6`), card internal padding tightened (`py-10` → `py-8`), logo and subtitle margins trimmed, and the default window height increased from 600 px to 660 px so both screens fit without scrolling in the multi-journal case.

### Changed

- **PHILOSOPHY.md restructured and expanded**: split into Part I (what and why for each principle) and Part II (how each principle is implemented in the codebase). Added concrete extension/plugin system description, E2E test stack guidance, rationale for the no-password-recovery rule, OS integration and Rhai scripting as justified complexity examples, a typo fix ("rich-text support"), a clarification distinguishing local Rhai plugins from plugin marketplaces, a version/date header, and a new "Honest threat documentation" non-negotiable. README now links to PHILOSOPHY.md under a dedicated Philosophy section.


## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-21

### Added

- **macOS menu bar**: proper App menu (About, Preferences, Services, Hide, Quit), Edit menu (Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All for standard keyboard shortcuts), and Window menu (Minimize, Zoom, Close). The custom menu is now installed app-wide via Tauri `AppHandle::set_menu` (instead of `window.set_menu`, which is unsupported on macOS), so menu actions and shortcuts work correctly on macOS.
- **Lock-state menu enforcement**: Navigation and Diary menu items are disabled while the diary is locked and automatically re-enable on unlock, preventing spurious menu actions on the lock screen. File/Help items (Preferences, About, Quit) remain available at all times.
- **About from menu**: Help › About (Windows/Linux) and Mini Diarium › About (macOS) now open the About overlay.
- **Auto-lock on Windows session lock/suspend**: the app now listens for native Windows session/power events and auto-locks the diary when the session is locked/logged off or the system is suspending.
- **E2E test suite**: end-to-end tests using WebdriverIO + tauri-driver that exercise the full app stack (real binary, real SQLite). The core workflow test covers diary creation, writing an entry, locking, and verifying persistence after unlock. Run locally with `bun run test:e2e`; runs automatically in CI on Ubuntu after the build step.

### Security

- **Key material zeroized on all exit paths**: wrapping keys derived during `wrap_master_key` and `unwrap_master_key` are now explicitly zeroed before returning on both the success path and every error path (wrong password, wrong key file, decryption failure). Previously the wrapping key bytes could remain in memory whenever an incorrect credential was entered.
- **Auth structs zeroize on drop**: `PasswordMethod` and `PrivateKeyMethod` now implement `ZeroizeOnDrop`; memory is reliably overwritten when the struct is dropped, regardless of call site.
- **Keypair unlock buffer zeroized**: the intermediate `Vec<u8>` holding private key bytes decoded from the key file during `unlock_diary_with_keypair` is now explicitly zeroized immediately after copying into the stack array.
- **`SecretBytes` newtype for decrypted master key**: `unwrap_master_key` now returns `SecretBytes` (a `ZeroizeOnDrop` wrapper) instead of a bare `Vec<u8>`, enforcing automatic cleanup of master key material regardless of whether the caller remembers to call `.zeroize()`.
- **Mutex poisoning handled gracefully**: all Tauri command handlers now propagate a `"State lock poisoned"` error instead of panicking via `.unwrap()` if a thread panics while holding the diary state lock. Previously a single panicking thread could permanently crash the app for the user.
- **Diary directory config rejects relative paths**: `config.json` entries with relative paths (e.g. `../../etc/passwd`) are now silently rejected; only absolute paths are accepted.
- **`migrate_v3_to_v4` is now atomic**: the two-statement migration that drops the plaintext FTS table and bumps the schema version is now wrapped in a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`/`COMMIT` transaction, consistent with other migrations.

### Fixed

- **Ordered lists in Markdown export**: entries containing numbered lists (`<ol>`) now export as `1. First`, `2. Second`, etc. instead of being silently converted to unordered bullet lists.
- **Word counts inflated by HTML markup**: word counts for entries written in the rich-text editor were inflated because HTML tags (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.) were counted as word tokens. `count_words` now strips tags before counting. Existing stored word counts are not retroactively corrected, but new writes and updates are accurate.
- **Export JSON version always showed `0.1.0`**: the `metadata.version` field in JSON exports now reflects the actual app version instead of the hardcoded string `"0.1.0"`.
- **Startup directory errors are now logged**: failure to determine the system app-data directory or to create the app directory now emits a warning to the log instead of silently falling back or ignoring the error.
- **Export no longer does N+1 queries**: JSON and Markdown export previously fetched entry dates and then queried each entry individually. All entries are now fetched and decrypted in a single SQL query.
- E2E CI failure on Linux: `browserName: 'edge'` is now set only on Windows (required by msedgedriver/WebView2) and omitted entirely on Linux. WebKitWebDriver (webkit2gtk-driver) rejects both `'edge'` and an empty string `''`; omitting the key means no browser-name constraint is imposed, which satisfies WebKitWebDriver's W3C capability matching.
- E2E spec (`e2e/specs/diary-workflow.spec.ts`) is now excluded from the Vitest unit test run, preventing a `ReferenceError: browser is not defined` failure when running `bun run test:run`.
- macOS CI build failure with Tauri `2.10.x`: updated predefined menu item calls to the current API (`services/hide/hide_others/show_all` now pass `None` label argument, and Window menu `zoom` was replaced with `maximize`).
- Bundle identifier warning on macOS: changed app identifier from `com.minidiarium.app` to `com.minidiarium`, and added startup compatibility fallback so existing installs using the legacy `com.minidiarium.app` app-data directory continue to load their existing diary/config.
- **Auto-lock UI desync after OS lock**: backend lock operations now emit a `diary-locked` event so the frontend immediately transitions to the lock screen instead of remaining in an unusable unlocked layout.

- **Custom diary location**: choose where your diary file is stored (Preferences → Diary File → Change Location). The file is moved to the selected folder and the choice persists across restarts, enabling cloud sync via Dropbox, OneDrive, or any folder-based sync tool. The diary is automatically locked during the move; the app reloads so you can re-authenticate from the new location.
- **Website contact obfuscation**: footer email link now renders via `data-*` attributes plus inline script so the address is reconstructed in the browser and not present in the raw HTML.

### Changed

- **Documentation diagrams synced with codebase**: refreshed architecture/context diagrams to match the current SolidJS signal state model, command/backend layout, and security posture (no plaintext search index); updated stale `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` diagram references and regeneration instructions; added light-theme `architecture.svg` generation and CI existence checks alongside `architecture-dark.svg`.



## [0.2.1] — 2026-02-19

### Added

- Public website at [mini-diarium.com](https://mini-diarium.com) (`website/` subfolder, served via nginx on Docker)
- Website SEO: canonical URL, author meta, JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` structured data, `og:image` switched to GIF, `twitter:card` upgraded to `summary_large_image`, `<main>` landmark, `id="demo"` anchor, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`

### Fixed

- Website: Proofreading, fixed corrupted Linux platform icon SVG path, added `width`/`height` to demo GIF to prevent layout shift
- macOS "damaged and can't be opened" error: added ad-hoc code signing (`signingIdentity: "-"`) and updated installation instructions to use `xattr -cr` workaround
- macOS release builds now correctly produce a universal binary (arm64 + x86_64) by passing `--target universal-apple-darwin` to the build step
- The entries_skipped field was declared but never used, it was added a condition in the for loop to skip and count entries that have no meaningful content rather than inserting empty records. by @Yujonpradhananga



## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Key file authentication**: unlock your diary with an X25519 private key file instead of (or in addition to) your password
- **Multiple unlock methods**: register more than one key file alongside your password; all are listed and manageable in Preferences → Authentication Methods
- **Key file generation**: generate a new X25519 keypair and save the private key to a `.key` file directly from Preferences
- **Auth Methods section in Preferences**: view all registered unlock methods, add a new key file, or remove existing ones (the last remaining method is always protected)
- `verify_password` command for side-effect-free password validation, used internally before multi-step operations
- **Lock button**: lock the diary instantly from the header toolbar without closing the app
- **About dialog**: view app version, description, license, and a link to the GitHub repository via the Info button in the header

### Security

- Remove plaintext FTS search index (`entries_fts` table); existing databases are migrated to schema v4 which drops the table on first unlock. Search is disabled until a secure implementation is available.
- Key file now written with mode 0o600 (owner read/write only) on Unix; Windows relies on NTFS ACLs (H1)
- Import commands now reject files larger than 100 MB to prevent out-of-memory conditions (H2)
- Content Security Policy enabled in webview (M2)

### Fixed

- Password change now enforces 8-character minimum, consistent with diary creation (M1)
- Backup files now use `.db` extension instead of `.txt` (L1)
- Confirmation dialogs for removing an auth method and resetting the diary now use native Tauri dialogs instead of `window.confirm()`, which was silently returning `true` in WebView2 on Windows regardless of user input
- Add Password form now appears in Preferences → Authentication Methods when the password slot has been removed, allowing users to re-register a password via the `register_password` command (uses the master key already held in the unlocked session)

### Changed

- Clicking a day in the calendar sidebar now automatically collapses the sidebar so the selected entry is immediately visible
- Backend error messages mapped to user-friendly strings before display in the UI (M3)
- Export overlay now warns that exported files are unencrypted plaintext (L4)
- Database schema upgraded to v3: entries are now encrypted with a random master key, with each authentication method storing its own wrapped copy in a new `auth_slots` table (replaces the `password_hash` table)
- `change_password` now re-wraps the master key in O(1) — no entry re-encryption required regardless of diary size
- Existing v1 and v2 databases are automatically migrated to v3 then v4 on the first unlock
- App icon and logo updated across all platforms (Windows ICO, macOS ICNS, Linux PNG, Windows AppX, iOS, Android); logo also shown on the unlock and diary creation screens
