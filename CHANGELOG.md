# Versions


## [0.4.13] - 25-03-2026

### Added

- **Markdown export image handling**: embedded base64 images are no longer silently stripped on export. Two new export options appear in the Export dialog:
    - **Markdown** (`builtin:markdown`) extracts images to a sibling `assets/` folder and replaces `<img>` tags with relative `![Image N](assets/image-N.ext)` references — compatible with Obsidian, Typora, and VS Code
    - **Markdown (inline images)** (`builtin:markdown-inline`) embeds images as `![Image N](data:image/TYPE;base64,…)` data URIs for single-file portability in editors that support them
    - Backend test count: 249 → 265


## [0.4.11] - 24-03-2026

### Fixed

- **Text alignment lost after calendar navigation — final fix (issue #63)**: two independent bugs were responsible. *(1) Visual rendering (root cause)*: Tauri automatically injects a random `'nonce-...'` into all CSP directives at runtime; per the CSP spec a nonce in `style-src` causes `'unsafe-inline'` to be ignored, so TipTap's `style="text-align: center"` attributes were silently blocked by the browser every time alignment was applied or loaded — the data was saved correctly, only the rendering was stripped. Fixed by `"dangerousDisableAssetCspModification": ["style-src"]` in `tauri.conf.json`, preventing nonce injection into `style-src` while leaving `script-src` nonce-protected for Tauri's internal use. *(2) Save loss*: navigating from Day A to Day B with a pre-existing blank entry caused `onSetContent(isEmpty=true)` to call `debouncedSave()` with Day B's blank args, resetting the 500 ms timer and discarding any pending save for Day A. Fixed by flushing the current entry (cancel + immediate `saveCurrentById`) at the start of `loadEntriesForDate` before loading the new date; all signal reads use `untrack()` to prevent reactive loop. Additionally hardened all five save paths to read from `editor.getHTML()` directly rather than the SolidJS `content()` signal.


## [0.4.9] - 23-03-2026

### Fixed

- **Text alignment lost after calendar navigation (issue #63)**: alignment (justify, center, right) applied to an entry was permanently overwritten after navigating away and returning. Root cause: TipTap v3 changed `setContent`'s `emitUpdate` default from `false` (v2) to `true`, causing the programmatic content load in DiaryEditor's `createEffect` to fire `onUpdate`, which queued a debounced save with un-aligned HTML from the production bundle's intermediate `getHTML()` state. Fixed by passing `{ emitUpdate: false }` to suppress `onUpdate` for programmatic loads; a new `onSetContent` callback from DiaryEditor to EditorPanel (1) updates the `editorIsEmpty` reactive signal so the "add entry" button state stays correct, and (2) re-triggers `debouncedSave` for blank entries (preserving the auto-deletion-on-navigation behaviour that previously ran through the now-suppressed `onUpdate` path). Signal reads in the callback use `untrack()` to avoid adding spurious reactive dependencies to DiaryEditor's effect.
- **E2E layout white gap above auth screens**: three-part fix. (1) In E2E mode the Tauri window now sets its size to `800×660` *before* `win.show()` (in `lib.rs` setup) — previously the window opened at the production default (`800×780`). (2) All screen-filling containers (`JournalPicker`, `PasswordCreation`, `PasswordPrompt`, `App` loading state, `MainLayout`) now use `h-full` (height: 100% via the `html → body → #root` chain) instead of `h-screen`/`min-h-screen` (`100vh`), which may include the native app menu bar height in WebView2 on Windows. (3) Removed `browser.setWindowSize(800, 660)` from the `wdio.conf.ts` `before` hook — WebDriver `setWindowRect` is a post-render resize that uses a different window-size measurement than Tauri's `LogicalSize`, causing a second resize after CSS `100vh`/`height:100%` were already computed and re-introducing the layout mismatch.
- **"+" button stuck disabled after multi-entry navigation (two variants)**: fixed two related bugs where the "Add entry for this day" button became permanently disabled on a day with real content.
  - *Variant 1 (navigation arrow)*: clicking "+", getting a blank second entry, then navigating back via "←" left the "+" permanently disabled. Root cause: SolidJS re-evaluated `addDisabled` when `setPendingEntryId()` changed, but TipTap had not yet processed the loaded entry's content, so `editor.isEmpty` was stale. Fixed by adding an `editorIsEmpty` reactive signal updated in `handleContentUpdate` (called by TipTap's `onUpdate`), forcing re-evaluation after TipTap reflects the correct state.
  - *Variant 2 (day switch)*: same setup, but switching to a different day instead of using the arrow, then switching back, also blocked the "+". Root cause: the blank entry's debounced auto-delete (500 ms) called `setPendingEntryId(null)` and left the editor showing stale blank content even though the original real entry still existed. Fixed by having `saveCurrentById` auto-navigate to the nearest remaining entry after deleting a blank entry, so `pendingEntryId` is never left as `null` while real entries still exist on the day.

### Added

- **Multi-entry E2E tests**: new `e2e/specs/multi-entry.spec.ts` covering (A) multi-entry persistence after lock/unlock, (B) "+" recovery after backward navigation (v0.4.9 Variant 1 regression), and (C) "+" recovery after day switch with blank entry (v0.4.9 Variant 2 regression). `data-testid` attributes added to `EntryNavBar` (`entry-nav-bar`, `entry-prev-button`, `entry-counter`, `entry-next-button`, `entry-delete-button`, `entry-add-button`) to support reliable E2E selectors.
- **Backend assessment follow-up** (Task 71): addressed all actionable findings from the March 2026 assessment. Two code quality fixes: `delete_entry` unlock guard now uses the consistent "Journal must be unlocked to …" error message (A1); `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions in `jrnl.rs` now carry "why" comments on the attribute line per project convention (A2). Ten new backend tests added: `delete_entry` command logic (A3), `navigate_to_today` valid-date assertion (A4), `update_slot_last_used` NULL→non-null column check (A5), import/export plugin "not found" error message format (A6), `MAX_IMPORT_FILE_SIZE` boundary (A7), and isolated v3→v4 and v4→v5 migration tests (A8). Comments added to `migrate_v3_to_v4` and `migrate_v4_to_v5` explaining why no pre-migration backup is taken (A9). Backend test count: 239 → 249.
- **Backend architectural assessment** ( temporarely stored at `docs/BACKEND_ASSESSMENT_2026-03.md`): full health-check of all 42 Rust source files covering architecture alignment, code quality, security posture, and test coverage.
- **Known issues document** (`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`): comprehensive reference for all known limitations, deliberate tradeoffs, and technical debt — organized for both users (KI-1 to KI-9) and developers (AT-1 to AT-12, TD-1 to TD-5). Replaces the single-bullet entry in README.md.
- **Journal name on unlock screen**: the unlock screen now shows the name of the selected journal ("Unlock *My Journal*") instead of the generic "Unlock your journal" subtitle. Falls back to the generic text when no journal name is available.
- **Accessibility improvements**: comprehensive ARIA audit and fixes across the app. Editor toolbar now has `role="toolbar"` and `aria-pressed` on all toggle buttons (bold, italic, lists, alignment, etc.). Error and success message regions across all overlays and auth screens now carry `role="alert"` / `role="status"` for automatic screen-reader announcement. Loading spinners use `aria-busy` and `aria-hidden`. Calendar grid now exposes full WCAG `role="grid"` / `role="row"` / `role="gridcell"` / `role="columnheader"` semantics with `aria-selected`, `aria-current="date"`, and descriptive `aria-label` on each day button; arrow-key navigation (←→ day, ↑↓ week, Home/End month, PageUp/PageDown month) added so the calendar is fully keyboard-operable. Preferences dialog tabs now implement the ARIA tab pattern (`role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`) with Left/Right arrow key switching. Hamburger button gains `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Mobile sidebar overlay gains focus trapping and focus restoration. Journal picker list uses `<ul>`/`<li>` semantics. Password strength indicator announces changes via `aria-live="polite"`.


## [0.4.8] - 18-03-2026

### Changed

- **Vite 8 upgrade**: bumped `vite` from 7.3.1 → 8.0.0 and `jsdom` from 28.1.0 → 29.0.0. Converted `manualChunks` in `vite.config.ts` from object to function form, as required by Vite 8's rolldown bundler. Vendor chunk output (`vendor-solid`, `vendor-tiptap`, `vendor-ui`) is unchanged.
- **Image alignment**: alignment controls now apply to images as well as text blocks, using a container model that makes future block types (tables, etc.) trivially alignable without per-node workarounds. Each image is wrapped in a `<figure class="image-container">` element; `TextAlign` sets `text-align` on the container and the inner `<img>` responds as `display: inline-block`. Existing bare `<img>` entries load correctly via a parse fallback (no migration needed).


## [0.4.7] — 15-03-2026

### Added

- **Editor alignment controls**: paragraphs and headings can now be aligned **left**, **center**, **right**, or **justified** using four new toolbar buttons. The controls live in the advanced toolbar (requires **Preferences → Writing → Show advanced formatting toolbar**). Alignment is stored as an inline `style="text-align: …"` attribute on the block element so it round-trips cleanly through save/load. Existing entries with no alignment metadata continue to render exactly as before. JSON export preserves the stored HTML unchanged; Markdown export degrades alignment gracefully without dropping content. Closes [#54](https://github.com/fjrevoredo/mini-diarium/issues/54).
- **Entry timestamps**: the editor can now show the `date_created` and `date_updated` timestamps for the current entry below the title, formatted using the OS locale. Opt-in via **Preferences → Writing → Show entry timestamps** (disabled by default). The updated timestamp is only shown when it differs from the created timestamp. Both timestamps are hidden when "Hide Titles" is enabled.
- **Theme overrides (advanced)**: advanced users can now override individual theme color tokens. Open **Preferences → General → Theme Overrides**, enter a JSON object with `light` and/or `dark` keys mapping CSS variable names (`--bg-primary`, `--text-primary`, etc.) to values, then click **Apply Overrides**. Overrides persist in `localStorage` and are layered on top of the active built-in theme automatically at startup. The documented token contract (`--bg-*`, `--text-*`, `--border-*`, `--interactive-*`, `--btn-*`, `--editor-*`, `--status-*`, `--spinner-color`, `--overlay-bg`, `--shadow-*`) is supported; unknown tokens are silently ignored. **Reset to Default** removes all overrides immediately. `auto` theme resolution continues to work correctly with overrides applied on top of the resolved light/dark theme.

### Fixed

- **Dark mode editor body text too dark**: two layered issues caused editor body text to appear dark-on-dark in dark mode. (1) `--editor-body-text` in the `.dark` token set was hardcoded to `#e5e7eb` (gray-200) instead of `var(--text-primary)` (`#f9fafb`); the token now follows `--text-primary` consistently in both themes. (2) The `color` rule was declared on `.ProseMirror` (single-class specificity), which lost to `@tailwindcss/typography`'s `.prose` rule injected later in the stylesheet. The `color` declaration has been moved to `.ProseMirror.journal-editor-content` (double-class specificity), exactly as was already done for `font-size` for the same reason.
- **Heading-style dropdown focus ring in editor toolbar**: the text-style `<select>` was using the raw palette class `focus:ring-blue-500` instead of the semantic `focus:ring-[var(--border-focus)]` token introduced during theme hardening.

### Changed

- **Theme system hardening**: all raw palette classes (`bg-blue-600`, `bg-red-600`, `border-blue-600`, `text-blue-500`, `text-red-500`, etc.) have been replaced with semantic CSS variable tokens and utility classes across 13 component files and `src/styles/editor.css`. New tokens added to `src/index.css`: `--btn-primary-*`, `--btn-destructive-*`, `--btn-active-*`, `--spinner-color` (button/spinner family), and `--editor-*` (editor content family). New utility classes: `.interactive-primary`, `.interactive-destructive`, `.text-destructive`, `.btn-active`, `.spinner-border`, `.text-interactive`, `.bg-interactive`. `editor.css` now uses only CSS variables with no `.dark`-specific override blocks. This task establishes the stable token contract for future user theme overrides (Task 69).


## [0.4.6] — 08-03-2026

### Added

- **Automatic WinGet publishing**: every published release now automatically submits a WinGet manifest update to the community repository (`microsoft/winget-pkgs`), opening a pull request for the new version. The workflow triggers on `release.published` events (not drafts), handles the `vX.Y.Z` tag format by stripping the `v` prefix, verifies the Windows asset `Mini-Diarium-{VERSION}-windows.exe` exists, and uses `wingetcreate.exe --submit` to auto-submit the PR. Users can install/upgrade via `winget install fjrevoredo.MiniDiarium` and `winget upgrade fjrevoredo.MiniDiarium`. Requires the `WINGET_TOKEN` repository secret to be configured.

### Fixed

- **Dark theme form-control contrast on Linux**: text inside password fields, plain text inputs, and native `<select>` dropdowns is now always readable in dark mode regardless of the active GTK theme. Added `color-scheme: light` / `color-scheme: dark` to `:root` / `.dark` so WebKit/GTK respects the app's color scheme for native form-control rendering. Added a zero-specificity `:where()` baseline that sets `background-color: var(--bg-primary)` and `color: var(--text-primary)` on all non-checkbox/radio/range/file inputs, selects, and textareas — any UnoCSS utility class (`bg-primary`, `bg-tertiary`, `disabled:bg-tertiary`, etc.) overrides it. Auth-screen password inputs in `PasswordPrompt` and `PasswordCreation` now carry explicit `bg-primary` classes. Fixes [#48](https://github.com/fjrevoredo/mini-diarium/issues/48).
- **About dialog now accessible from the native menu at any auth state**: the `AboutOverlay` and its `menu-about` listener have been lifted from `MainLayout` (unlocked-only) up to `App` (always mounted). Help → About Mini Diarium now opens correctly from the journal picker, password prompt, and creation screens — not just when the journal is unlocked.
- **E2E: title persistence assertion now waits for async DB load**: replaced `waitForDisplayed` + immediate `getValue` with a `waitUntil` poll, preventing a race between the WebDriver assertion and the async `loadEntriesForDate` round-trip to the backend.
- **Backup rotation limit reduced from 50 to 30**: the `MAX_BACKUPS` constant has been lowered and a new test `test_backup_and_rotate_repeated_unlocks()` verifies that repeated unlock operations never allow the backup count to exceed the configured cap. All test assertions now use the constant instead of hardcoded values.


## [0.4.5] — 06-03-2026

### Added

- **Advanced tab in Preferences** with a "Generate Debug Dump" button — exports a privacy-safe JSON diagnostic file (app version, OS/platform, schema version, entry counts, auth method types, backup count, plugin count, preferences); no entry content, passwords, or key material is ever included
- **Month/year picker in calendar header**: clicking the month/year label in the sidebar calendar now toggles an inline month picker. The calendar body switches to a 3×4 month grid with year-step arrows; selecting a month jumps directly to that month and closes the picker. The currently displayed month is highlighted in the grid. No new dependencies. (#43)
- **Delete entry button for multi-entry days**: a "−" button now appears next to the "+" button in the entry navigator when a day has more than one entry. Clicking "−" opens a confirmation dialog ("Delete Entry" — "Are you sure you want to delete this entry?") and, if confirmed, deletes the currently selected entry and navigates to the next available entry for the same day (staying at the same index, clamping to bounds if the last entry was deleted). The button is only visible when the day has multiple entries and is disabled while an entry is being created. (#43)

### Changed

- **Unified user-facing terminology to "Journal"**: all UI text, error messages, and documentation now consistently use "Journal" instead of the mixed "diary"/"journal" wording; internal Tauri command names and filesystem identifiers (`diary.db`) are preserved for compatibility (issue #46)
- **Auto-select last-used journal on startup**: the app now skips the Journal Picker when a previously used journal is known (`active_journal_id` set in config). `initializeAuth()` calls `refreshAuthState()` directly and transitions to the password prompt (or unlocked state if already unlocked). The Journal Picker is shown only on a fresh install or when no active journal is configured. (#43)
- **Reduced password minimum length to 1 character:** the 8-character minimum has been removed. Passwords must be non-empty; a visual strength indicator now guides users with feedback on weak/medium/strong passwords. Very weak passwords show an additional warning banner with recommendations. This aligns with the cryptographic reality that Argon2id protects any password length, while giving users control over their security tradeoffs. (#43)
- **Website SEO/GEO follow-up pass (2026-03-06)**: replaced the 4.5 MB hero GIF with compressed MP4/WebM demo media plus a poster image, switched the stylesheet to inline-critical + non-blocking loading, updated title/description metadata for search intent, replaced the social preview SVG with a PNG, changed the hero download CTAs to distinct Windows/macOS/Linux direct installer links with ARIA labels, added apex-canonical redirect/cache parity to the nginx reference config, and documented post-release Search Console/IndexNow/Cloudflare ops in the release guide.

### Fixed

- **Window position flash on startup**: the main window no longer flashes at the default position before jumping to the saved position. The window is now created hidden (`"visible": false` in `tauri.conf.json`) and shown explicitly after `tauri-plugin-window-state` has restored the saved bounds. (#43)
- **"+" add-entry button**: the button to create an additional entry for the same day now correctly guards against concurrent calls using a reactive signal. The button is disabled while creation is in flight, preventing duplicate entries from rapid clicks. Errors are no longer silently swallowed. (#43)
- **"Go to today" calendar button**: clicking the calendar icon in the sidebar now correctly navigates the calendar month view. A `createEffect` in `Calendar.tsx` watches `selectedDate` and syncs `currentMonth` whenever the selected date falls outside the currently displayed month — fixing all month-navigation cases including "go to today", go-to-date overlay, and day/month menu navigation. (#43)
- **Clicking adjacent-month days in calendar**: days from the previous or next month shown in the calendar grid are now clickable. The `isCurrentMonth` guard has been removed from `handleDayClick` and the `disabled` attribute; only future dates (when the preference is off) remain disabled. (#43)
- **Sidebar header border alignment**: the sidebar title bar and the main header bar now share the same rendered height (64 px). Previously the sidebar's text-only header was 12 px shorter than the main header whose icon buttons set the height, causing the bottom borders to visually misalign. (#43)
- **"Go to today" button alignment**: the button in the sidebar was right-aligned (`justify-end`) while the calendar below it is left-aligned. Changed to `justify-start` so the button aligns with the calendar's left edge. (#43)
- **Settings tab active state on light theme**: the active tab in Preferences used hardcoded Tailwind classes (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-700`) that could render with low contrast. Replaced with CSS-variable classes (`bg-active text-primary`) that correctly follow the current theme in both light and dark mode. (#43)
- **Editor placeholder showing "Loading…"**: TipTap's placeholder extension showed "Loading…" whenever the editor was empty during an async entry load, which could flicker on fast navigations. Placeholders are now always static ("Title (optional)" / "What's on your mind today?"). (#43)
- **Calendar month navigation broken by reactive loop**: clicking the previous/next month buttons had no effect because the `createEffect` that syncs `currentMonth` to `selectedDate` was also reading `currentMonth()` as a reactive dependency — causing it to immediately reset the month back. Fixed by using `untrack(currentMonth)` so the effect only re-runs when `selectedDate` changes.
- **"+" button creates spurious entry on empty day**: pressing "+" when no content existed would create and immediately delete an empty entry (visible briefly as a dot in the calendar). The button is now disabled unless the current entry has body content. Contextual tooltip text explains why the button is disabled ("Write something first to add another entry for this day") or what it does when enabled ("Add another entry for this day").
- **New entry auto-deleted 500 ms after creation**: after creating a new entry via "+", `setContent('')` caused TipTap to fire `onUpdate` synchronously with empty content, scheduling a debounced save that would delete the blank entry. An explicit `debouncedSave.cancel()` now runs immediately after state is reset to prevent this.
- **Multi-entry day counter order**: entries for a day are now displayed in chronological order (oldest = 1/N, newest = N/N). Previously the backend's newest-first ordering made the counter confusingly start at 1 for the most-recent entry. New entries created via "+" always land at position N/N. Opening a multi-entry day now navigates to the newest entry (N/N) instead of the oldest.
- **Empty entries persist on lock/switch**: empty entries created with the "+" button now correctly delete themselves when the diary is locked or when switching journals without adding content. Previously, the empty entry would remain in the database until the user navigated to a different entry. The fix implements a pre-lock event pattern that ensures `saveCurrentById()` (which deletes empty entries) is called before the database is locked, covering all lock paths (manual button, OS session lock, and journal switching).

## [0.4.4] — 03-03-2026

### Added

- **Text highlight formatting** in the advanced editor toolbar (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H`). Highlighted text is rendered with a yellow background (theme-safe in light and dark mode). HTML `<mark>` tags are preserved in storage and JSON export; Markdown export strips the tags and keeps the text. (#41)
- **Embedded images in the editor**: images can now be inserted into diary entries via drag-and-drop, clipboard paste (Ctrl/Cmd+V), or the new "Insert image" button in the advanced toolbar. Images are resized client-side (max 1200 × 1200 px, JPEG 85% quality) before embedding as base64 data URIs in the encrypted entry HTML. Plaintext never touches disk. Note: JSON/Markdown exports will include the full base64 strings and may be large for entries with many images. (#40)
- **Configurable editor font size** (12–24 px) in Preferences → Writing (#30)

## [0.4.3] — 01-03-2026

### Added

- **Expanded rich text toolbar**: heading selector (Normal / H1 / H2 / H3), Underline, Strikethrough, Blockquote, Inline Code, and Horizontal Rule buttons added to the editor toolbar. Markdown export now correctly converts strikethrough (`~~`), blockquotes (`>`), inline code (`` ` ``), and fenced code blocks (` ``` `).
- **Minimal toolbar by default**: a new **Show advanced formatting toolbar** preference (Preferences → Writing) controls whether the extended toolbar controls are visible. The default is off — the toolbar shows only Bold, Italic, Bullet List, and Ordered List. Toggling the setting on reveals the full toolbar (headings, Underline, Strikethrough, Blockquote, Inline Code, Horizontal Rule) immediately without restarting. Rendering of existing content and import/export behavior are unaffected by this setting.
- **Configurable auto-lock timeout**: a new **Auto-Lock** section in Preferences → Security lets you enable automatic locking after a period of inactivity. When enabled, any mouse movement, key press, click, touch, or scroll resets the idle timer; the diary locks automatically once the timeout (1–999 seconds, default 300) expires with no activity. The setting is stored in `localStorage` and takes effect immediately without restarting.
- **Auto-lock on macOS screen lock**: the diary now auto-locks when the display sleeps, the system enters sleep, or the user explicitly locks the screen (Cmd+Ctrl+Q / Apple menu → Lock Screen) on macOS. Uses `NSWorkspaceScreensDidSleepNotification`, `NSWorkspaceWillSleepNotification`, and `com.apple.screenIsLocked` via `NSDistributedNotificationCenter`.
- **Multiple entries per day**: each diary day can now hold any number of independent entries. A `←` / `→` navigation bar appears above the editor when a day has more than one entry, showing the current position (e.g. `2 / 3`). A `+` button on the right side of the bar creates a new blank entry for the same date. Single-entry days look and behave exactly as before — the navigation bar is hidden.
- **Entry identity**: each entry now carries a stable `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` id. Saves, deletes, and exports all reference entries by id rather than by date.

### Changed

- **Database schema bumped to v5**: the `entries` table gains an `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` column; the old `date TEXT PRIMARY KEY` unique constraint is replaced by a non-unique `idx_entries_date` index. Existing databases are migrated automatically on first launch (entries are preserved in date-creation order).
- **Import no longer merges same-date entries**: previously, importing a file with entries that matched an existing date would merge the content. Imports now always create a new entry, consistent with the multiple-entries-per-day model. The `entries_merged` field has been removed from the import result.
- **JSON export format changed to an array**: the exported JSON file now contains an `"entries"` array (each object includes an `"id"` field) instead of a date-keyed object. This format can represent multiple entries per day correctly. The `"metadata"` wrapper (`application`, `version`, `exportedAt`) is unchanged.
- **Markdown export groups multiple entries per day**: when a day has more than one entry, each entry appears as a `### Entry N` sub-heading (or `### {title}` if the entry has a title) under the day's `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading.

### Fixed

- **Streak calculation now counts distinct days**: with multiple entries per date, the statistics streak algorithm now deduplicates dates before computing streaks, ensuring one active day is counted once regardless of how many entries it contains.

## [0.4.2] — 28-02-2026

### Added

- **Journal Picker as the outermost app layer**: the app now opens to a **Journal Picker** screen before any diary authentication. The picker lists all configured journals and lets you open, rename, or remove any of them without authenticating first. You can also create a new diary (picks a folder, names it, then goes to password creation) or open an existing `diary.db` from any folder — both flows that were previously fragmented across the first-launch screen and Preferences > Journals. On a shared device, each person can select their own diary without having to step through someone else's lock screen.
- **"← Back to Journals" link** on both `PasswordCreation` and `PasswordPrompt` screens, letting users navigate back to the journal picker without locking or restarting the app.
- **Removing the last journal is now allowed**: the backend no longer blocks removal of the sole remaining journal; the picker simply shows the empty state with the two Add buttons so the user can configure a new one.

### Changed

- **Journal management moved to the Journal Picker**: the **Journals** tab has been removed from Preferences. All journal operations (add, rename, remove, open) are available on the pre-auth picker screen. Auth methods, password changes, and data settings remain in their respective Preferences tabs unchanged.
- **Auth flow**: `initializeAuth()` now always routes to `'journal-select'` on startup (instead of probing the diary path immediately); `refreshAuthState()` is called only after the user selects a journal. This eliminates the single-user assumption baked into the previous startup sequence.
- **Release build profile**: added `[profile.release]` with `opt-level = 3` and `lto = true` to `Cargo.toml` for smaller, faster distribution binaries.
- **Website SEO/GEO refresh (2026)**: upgraded metadata and machine-readable signals for search and AI retrieval. Added robots snippet controls, richer Open Graph/Twitter tags (`og:site_name`, `og:locale`, image dimensions, account attribution), expanded JSON-LD graph (`SoftwareApplication` + `Organization` + `WebSite` + `FAQPage` with `softwareVersion`/`dateModified`), added extraction-friendly **Quick facts** + **FAQ** sections, introduced a dedicated **Release status** block with explicit last-updated date, replaced placeholder `href="#"` links, updated sitemap to use `<lastmod>`, and added a lightweight social preview asset (`website/assets/og-cover.svg`).
- **Website compatibility and cache hardening (2026-02-26)**: added a broader favicon set (`favicon.ico`, 16/32/128 PNG, `apple-touch-icon`), published `ai-crawlers.txt` and `llms.txt` with footer/README discoverability, and introduced content-hash fingerprinting for website CSS/JS (`website:fingerprint`) so nginx can safely keep `immutable` only for hashed assets while unfingerprinted files use short TTL caching.

## [0.4.1] — 25-02-2026

### Added

- **ESC key can now quit the app** (#25): a new "ESC key action" preference (General tab) lets you choose between _Do nothing_ (default, unchanged behaviour) and _Quit the app_. When set to Quit, pressing Escape anywhere on the main screen closes the application — identical to clicking the title-bar X button, so the autosave `beforeunload` handler fires normally. The shortcut is suppressed whenever any dialog is open, so Escape still dismisses overlays as before.
- **Preferences panel reorganised into tabs**: the single long-scroll preferences dialog is now a sidebar-tab layout with five tabs — **General** (theme, ESC action), **Writing** (calendar and editor options), **Journals** (journal management), **Security** (auth methods, change password), and **Data** (diary path, move location, reset). Writing and Security tabs are grayed out and non-clickable while the diary is locked.
- **Sidebar starts collapsed on launch and unlock** (#24): the app now opens directly to today's entry without the calendar panel obscuring the editor. The sidebar can still be toggled via the menu button. After locking and unlocking, the view resets to today's entry with the sidebar closed.
- **Window size and position are remembered between sessions** (#26): the app restores the window dimensions and position from the previous session. First launch still uses the default 800×660 px. Powered by `tauri-plugin-window-state`.
- **Official user-plugin example and guides**: added `docs/user-plugins/plain-text-timeline.rhai` as a reference Rhai export plugin, plus dedicated built-in/user plugin guides for requirements, testing, and best practices.

### Changed

- **Plugin documentation structure simplified**: user plugin documentation and canonical example now live together in `docs/user-plugins/` for discoverability; README now links to this area from a dedicated **Extending Mini Diarium** section.
- **E2E test isolation hardened**: `bun run test:e2e` now runs in deterministic clean-room mode (isolated diary data, isolated WebView profile on Windows, fixed 800×660 viewport, and backend window-state persistence disabled via `MINI_DIARIUM_E2E=1`), with `bun run test:e2e:stateful` available for persistence-focused checks in a repo-local state directory.

## [0.4.0] - 25-02-2026

### Added

- **Extension system for import/export formats**: built-in formats (Mini Diary JSON, Day One JSON, Day One TXT, jrnl JSON, JSON export, Markdown export) are now served through a unified plugin registry. Users can add custom import/export formats by dropping `.rhai` scripts into a `plugins/` folder inside their diary directory. Rhai scripts run in a secure sandbox (no file system, no network, operation limits enforced). A `README.md` with templates and API docs is auto-generated in the `plugins/` folder on first launch.
- **Multiple journals**: configure and switch between multiple journals (e.g. personal, work, travel) from the login screen. A dropdown selector appears on the password/key-file unlock screen when more than one journal is configured. Journals are managed in Preferences (add, rename, remove, switch). Each journal is an independent encrypted `diary.db` in its own directory. Existing single-diary setups are automatically migrated — no action required. The "Change Location" feature in Preferences stays in sync with the active journal's config.

### Fixed

- **Navigating to an empty date no longer creates a spurious calendar dot**: clicking into the editor on a date with no entry (without typing anything, or typing only whitespace) previously wrote an empty entry to the database because TipTap normalises an empty document to `<p></p>`, which bypassed the `!content.trim()` check. The save logic now uses TipTap's `editor.isEmpty || editor.getText().trim() === ''` to correctly identify empty and whitespace-only content, and passes `''` to the backend deletion guard so it also passes. Fixes #22.
- **Keyboard shortcuts overhauled**: bracket-key accelerators (`CmdOrCtrl+[`/`]` for previous/next day, `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+[`/`]` for previous/next month) replace the old arrow-key combos that conflicted with OS and TipTap text-navigation bindings. Removed the duplicate frontend `keydown` listener (`shortcuts.ts`) that caused every shortcut to fire twice. Removed accelerators from Statistics, Import, and Export that conflicted with TipTap italic (`Ctrl+I`) and Chromium DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`). All shortcut definitions now live exclusively in `menu.rs` as OS-level menu accelerators.
- **CI diagram verification now detects stale outputs**: the "Verify diagrams are up-to-date" workflow step now compares each regenerated `*-check.svg` file with its committed SVG counterpart and fails with a clear remediation message when any diagram differs.
- **Flaky diagram CI diffs resolved**: diagram rendering/checking is now centralized in `scripts/render-diagrams.mjs` and `scripts/verify-diagrams.mjs`; Mermaid always renders with a consistent Puppeteer config in both local and CI runs; CI uses `bun run diagrams:check` (project-locked Mermaid CLI instead of `bun x mmdc`), workflow Bun installs now use `--frozen-lockfile`, Bun is pinned to `1.2`, and D2 is pinned/validated at `v0.7.1` to prevent toolchain drift.
- **Editor now scales better on large/fullscreen windows**: the main writing column keeps the existing compact behavior on smaller screens, but expands its max width on larger displays and increases the editor's default writing area height on tall viewports to reduce unused space below the editor.
- **Session state is now fully reset on lock/logout boundaries**: locking the diary (manual lock button or backend-emitted `diary-locked` event from OS/session auto-lock flows) now clears transient frontend state so selected date, in-memory entry/search state, and open overlays do not leak across sessions or journal switches. Unlock now starts from a fresh `today` baseline; E2E coverage was updated accordingly.
- **Journal selection on auth screens no longer reverts to the previous journal**: switching journals from the locked/no-diary screen now updates auth status without reloading journal metadata in the same step, preventing the dropdown from briefly changing and then snapping back to the old journal.
- **Auth screens no longer clip content when multiple journals are configured**: the journal selector dropdown added in 0.4.0 pushed the unlock/create-diary cards past the 600 px window height, causing the top of the card to be clipped with no way to scroll. The layout now uses a column-flex + `my-auto` pattern so the card centres when space is available and the page scrolls naturally when it is not. Outer vertical padding was reduced (`py-12` → `py-6`), card internal padding tightened (`py-10` → `py-8`), logo and subtitle margins trimmed, and the default window height increased from 600 px to 660 px so both screens fit without scrolling in the multi-journal case.

### Changed

- **PHILOSOPHY.md restructured and expanded**: split into Part I (what and why for each principle) and Part II (how each principle is implemented in the codebase). Added concrete extension/plugin system description, E2E test stack guidance, rationale for the no-password-recovery rule, OS integration and Rhai scripting as justified complexity examples, a typo fix ("rich-text support"), a clarification distinguishing local Rhai plugins from plugin marketplaces, a version/date header, and a new "Honest threat documentation" non-negotiable. README now links to PHILOSOPHY.md under a dedicated Philosophy section.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-21

### Added

- **macOS menu bar**: proper App menu (About, Preferences, Services, Hide, Quit), Edit menu (Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All for standard keyboard shortcuts), and Window menu (Minimize, Zoom, Close). The custom menu is now installed app-wide via Tauri `AppHandle::set_menu` (instead of `window.set_menu`, which is unsupported on macOS), so menu actions and shortcuts work correctly on macOS.
- **Lock-state menu enforcement**: Navigation and Diary menu items are disabled while the diary is locked and automatically re-enable on unlock, preventing spurious menu actions on the lock screen. File/Help items (Preferences, About, Quit) remain available at all times.
- **About from menu**: Help › About (Windows/Linux) and Mini Diarium › About (macOS) now open the About overlay.
- **Auto-lock on Windows session lock/suspend**: the app now listens for native Windows session/power events and auto-locks the diary when the session is locked/logged off or the system is suspending.
- **E2E test suite**: end-to-end tests using WebdriverIO + tauri-driver that exercise the full app stack (real binary, real SQLite). The core workflow test covers diary creation, writing an entry, locking, and verifying persistence after unlock. Run locally with `bun run test:e2e`; runs automatically in CI on Ubuntu after the build step.

### Security

- **Key material zeroized on all exit paths**: wrapping keys derived during `wrap_master_key` and `unwrap_master_key` are now explicitly zeroed before returning on both the success path and every error path (wrong password, wrong key file, decryption failure). Previously the wrapping key bytes could remain in memory whenever an incorrect credential was entered.
- **Auth structs zeroize on drop**: `PasswordMethod` and `PrivateKeyMethod` now implement `ZeroizeOnDrop`; memory is reliably overwritten when the struct is dropped, regardless of call site.
- **Keypair unlock buffer zeroized**: the intermediate `Vec<u8>` holding private key bytes decoded from the key file during `unlock_diary_with_keypair` is now explicitly zeroized immediately after copying into the stack array.
- **`SecretBytes` newtype for decrypted master key**: `unwrap_master_key` now returns `SecretBytes` (a `ZeroizeOnDrop` wrapper) instead of a bare `Vec<u8>`, enforcing automatic cleanup of master key material regardless of whether the caller remembers to call `.zeroize()`.
- **Mutex poisoning handled gracefully**: all Tauri command handlers now propagate a `"State lock poisoned"` error instead of panicking via `.unwrap()` if a thread panics while holding the diary state lock. Previously a single panicking thread could permanently crash the app for the user.
- **Diary directory config rejects relative paths**: `config.json` entries with relative paths (e.g. `../../etc/passwd`) are now silently rejected; only absolute paths are accepted.
- **`migrate_v3_to_v4` is now atomic**: the two-statement migration that drops the plaintext FTS table and bumps the schema version is now wrapped in a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`/`COMMIT` transaction, consistent with other migrations.

### Fixed

- **Ordered lists in Markdown export**: entries containing numbered lists (`<ol>`) now export as `1. First`, `2. Second`, etc. instead of being silently converted to unordered bullet lists.
- **Word counts inflated by HTML markup**: word counts for entries written in the rich-text editor were inflated because HTML tags (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.) were counted as word tokens. `count_words` now strips tags before counting. Existing stored word counts are not retroactively corrected, but new writes and updates are accurate.
- **Export JSON version always showed `0.1.0`**: the `metadata.version` field in JSON exports now reflects the actual app version instead of the hardcoded string `"0.1.0"`.
- **Startup directory errors are now logged**: failure to determine the system app-data directory or to create the app directory now emits a warning to the log instead of silently falling back or ignoring the error.
- **Export no longer does N+1 queries**: JSON and Markdown export previously fetched entry dates and then queried each entry individually. All entries are now fetched and decrypted in a single SQL query.
- E2E CI failure on Linux: `browserName: 'edge'` is now set only on Windows (required by msedgedriver/WebView2) and omitted entirely on Linux. WebKitWebDriver (webkit2gtk-driver) rejects both `'edge'` and an empty string `''`; omitting the key means no browser-name constraint is imposed, which satisfies WebKitWebDriver's W3C capability matching.
- E2E spec (`e2e/specs/diary-workflow.spec.ts`) is now excluded from the Vitest unit test run, preventing a `ReferenceError: browser is not defined` failure when running `bun run test:run`.
- macOS CI build failure with Tauri `2.10.x`: updated predefined menu item calls to the current API (`services/hide/hide_others/show_all` now pass `None` label argument, and Window menu `zoom` was replaced with `maximize`).
- Bundle identifier warning on macOS: changed app identifier from `com.minidiarium.app` to `com.minidiarium`, and added startup compatibility fallback so existing installs using the legacy `com.minidiarium.app` app-data directory continue to load their existing diary/config.
- **Auto-lock UI desync after OS lock**: backend lock operations now emit a `diary-locked` event so the frontend immediately transitions to the lock screen instead of remaining in an unusable unlocked layout.

- **Custom diary location**: choose where your diary file is stored (Preferences → Diary File → Change Location). The file is moved to the selected folder and the choice persists across restarts, enabling cloud sync via Dropbox, OneDrive, or any folder-based sync tool. The diary is automatically locked during the move; the app reloads so you can re-authenticate from the new location.
- **Website contact obfuscation**: footer email link now renders via `data-*` attributes plus inline script so the address is reconstructed in the browser and not present in the raw HTML.

### Changed

- **Documentation diagrams synced with codebase**: refreshed architecture/context diagrams to match the current SolidJS signal state model, command/backend layout, and security posture (no plaintext search index); updated stale `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` diagram references and regeneration instructions; added light-theme `architecture.svg` generation and CI existence checks alongside `architecture-dark.svg`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-02-19

### Added

- Public website at [mini-diarium.com](https://mini-diarium.com) (`website/` subfolder, served via nginx on Docker)
- Website SEO: canonical URL, author meta, JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` structured data, `og:image` switched to GIF, `twitter:card` upgraded to `summary_large_image`, `<main>` landmark, `id="demo"` anchor, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`

### Fixed

- Website: Proofreading, fixed corrupted Linux platform icon SVG path, added `width`/`height` to demo GIF to prevent layout shift
- macOS "damaged and can't be opened" error: added ad-hoc code signing (`signingIdentity: "-"`) and updated installation instructions to use `xattr -cr` workaround
- macOS release builds now correctly produce a universal binary (arm64 + x86_64) by passing `--target universal-apple-darwin` to the build step
- The entries_skipped field was declared but never used, it was added a condition in the for loop to skip and count entries that have no meaningful content rather than inserting empty records. by @Yujonpradhananga

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Key file authentication**: unlock your diary with an X25519 private key file instead of (or in addition to) your password
- **Multiple unlock methods**: register more than one key file alongside your password; all are listed and manageable in Preferences → Authentication Methods
- **Key file generation**: generate a new X25519 keypair and save the private key to a `.key` file directly from Preferences
- **Auth Methods section in Preferences**: view all registered unlock methods, add a new key file, or remove existing ones (the last remaining method is always protected)
- `verify_password` command for side-effect-free password validation, used internally before multi-step operations
- **Lock button**: lock the diary instantly from the header toolbar without closing the app
- **About dialog**: view app version, description, license, and a link to the GitHub repository via the Info button in the header

### Security

- Remove plaintext FTS search index (`entries_fts` table); existing databases are migrated to schema v4 which drops the table on first unlock. Search is disabled until a secure implementation is available.
- Key file now written with mode 0o600 (owner read/write only) on Unix; Windows relies on NTFS ACLs (H1)
- Import commands now reject files larger than 100 MB to prevent out-of-memory conditions (H2)
- Content Security Policy enabled in webview (M2)

### Fixed

- Password change now enforces 8-character minimum, consistent with diary creation (M1)
- Backup files now use `.db` extension instead of `.txt` (L1)
- Confirmation dialogs for removing an auth method and resetting the diary now use native Tauri dialogs instead of `window.confirm()`, which was silently returning `true` in WebView2 on Windows regardless of user input
- Add Password form now appears in Preferences → Authentication Methods when the password slot has been removed, allowing users to re-register a password via the `register_password` command (uses the master key already held in the unlocked session)

### Changed

- Clicking a day in the calendar sidebar now automatically collapses the sidebar so the selected entry is immediately visible
- Backend error messages mapped to user-friendly strings before display in the UI (M3)
- Export overlay now warns that exported files are unencrypted plaintext (L4)
- Database schema upgraded to v3: entries are now encrypted with a random master key, with each authentication method storing its own wrapped copy in a new `auth_slots` table (replaces the `password_hash` table)
- `change_password` now re-wraps the master key in O(1) — no entry re-encryption required regardless of diary size
- Existing v1 and v2 databases are automatically migrated to v3 then v4 on the first unlock
- App icon and logo updated across all platforms (Windows ICO, macOS ICNS, Linux PNG, Windows AppX, iOS, Android); logo also shown on the unlock and diary creation screens
