A local-first journal with serious encryption. Free, open source, and never touches the internet.

Mini Diarium keeps your journal private. Every entry is encrypted with AES-256-GCM, the app never connects to the internet, and your data never leaves your machine. Built with Tauri, SolidJS, and Rust.

## Background

Mini Diarium is a spiritual successor to [Mini Diary](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/mini-diary) by Samuel Meuli. I loved the original tool. It was simple, private, and did exactly what a journal app should do. Unfortunately, it's been unmaintained for years and its dependencies have aged out. I initially thought about forking it and modernizing the stack, but turned out impractical. So I started over from scratch, keeping the same core philosophy (encrypted, local-only, focused) while rebuilding completely with Tauri 2, SolidJS, and Rust. The result is a lighter, faster app with stronger encryption and a few personal touches.

## Philosophy First

Mini Diarium is intentionally opinionated. The philosophy is not a side note, it is the product:

- **Small, extensible core**: keep core responsibilities tight (encrypt, store, authenticate) and push extras to extension points
- **Boring security**: use established algorithms and audited libraries, never custom crypto
- **Local-only by design**: no cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics, no hidden network behavior
- **Easy in, easy out**: import from common formats and export in open formats to avoid lock-in
- **Focused scope**: private journaling over feature sprawl
- **Simplicity over cleverness**: fewer moving parts, smaller attack surface, easier maintenance

Read the full principles and how these translates to the architecture in [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md).

## Features

- **Key file authentication**: unlock your diary with an X25519 private key file instead of (or alongside) your password, like SSH keys for your journal. Register multiple key files; manage all auth methods from Preferences. See [Key File Authentication](#key-file-authentication) for details.
- **AES-256-GCM encryption**: all entries are encrypted with a random master key. Each auth method holds its own wrapped copy of that key, so adding or removing a method is O(1), with no re-encryption of your entries.
- **Rich text editor**
- **Multiple entries per day**: keep separate entries for the same date without merging them together
- **Calendar navigation**
- **Import**: Mini Diary JSON, Day One JSON/TXT, and jrnl JSON with additive imports that preserve separate same-date entries
- **Export**: JSON for structural fidelity and Markdown for human-readable best-effort export
- **Themes**
- **Automatic backups**: backup on unlock with rotation
- **Statistics**
- **Preferences**: first day of week, future entries toggle, title visibility, spellcheck, password change, authentication method management
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Zero network access**: no telemetry, no analytics, no update checks

# Architecture

# Unlock Model

Mini Diarium uses a wrapped master key design.

- A random master key encrypts all entries using AES-256-GCM
- Authentication methods wrap the master key
- Unlocking unwraps the master key into memory for the session

## Unlock Flow

  <img alt="Unlock Flow Diagram" src="docs/diagrams/unlock.svg">
</picture>

### Password Unlock

- Argon2 key derivation
- AES-GCM unwrap of master key

### Key File Unlock

- X25519 key pair
- ECDH followed by HKDF
- AES-GCM unwrap of master key

The master key is never stored in plaintext.

---

## System Context

Everything runs locally on the user's machine.

</picture>

### Properties

- The UI communicates with the Rust backend via Tauri `invoke()`
- The backend reads and writes to local SQLite
- No HTTP clients
- No background sync
- No telemetry

# Saving an Entry

When saving an entry:

1. The content is encrypted using the master key.
2. The encrypted content is stored in the `entries` table.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:

| Platform | Format                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `.msi` or `.exe` (NSIS installer, no admin required) |
| macOS    | `.dmg`                                               |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` or `.deb`                                |

### Installation Notes

**Windows**

On first launch, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning ("Windows protected your PC"). This is expected for unsigned applications. Click "More info" then "Run anyway" to proceed. Mini Diarium is open source and builds are reproducible from source.

**macOS**

macOS Gatekeeper may block the app on first launch with **"damaged and can't be opened"**. This happens because the app is open-source and not commercially code-signed.

Run this command in Terminal after dragging the app to Applications:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Mini Diarium.app"
```

Then launch the app normally. This is a one-time step.

**Linux**

No code signing is required. For security, verify the SHA256 checksum against `checksums-linux.txt` from the release before installation:

```bash
sha256sum Mini-Diarium-*.AppImage
# Compare with checksums-linux.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Launch Mini Diarium
2. Create a password (this encrypts your diary; there is no recovery if forgotten)
3. Write your first entry. It auto-saves as you type
4. Navigate between days with `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` or click dates on the calendar
5. Lock your diary when you're done

## Key File Authentication

Most journal apps only offer a password. Mini Diarium also lets you unlock with an **X25519 private key file**, a small `.key` file that acts like an SSH key for your diary. You can use a key file instead of your password, or register both and use whichever is convenient.

### Why use a key file?

| Scenario | How a key file helps |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Physical second factor** | Keep the `.key` file on a USB drive. The diary can only be unlocked when the drive is plugged in, with no app, no phone, and no OTP codes. |
| **Password manager integration** | Store the `.key` file as a secure attachment. Unlock without memorizing a passphrase at all. |
| **Multiple machines** | Register one key file per machine. Revoke access to a single machine by removing that slot without touching your password or re-encrypting any entries. |
| **Shared account, separate keys** | Register several key files under different labels. Each is independent, and removing one doesn't affect the others. |

### How it works

Each auth method stores its own encrypted copy of a random **master key** that encrypts all diary entries. For key files, this wrapping uses **X25519 ECIES**:

1. A 256-bit master key is generated once when you create the diary and never changes.
2. You generate an X25519 keypair in Preferences. The app saves the **private key** to a `.key` file (64-character hex string) and retains only the **public key**.
3. The public key is used to wrap the master key: an ephemeral DH key exchange produces a one-time secret, HKDF-SHA256 derives a wrapping key from it, and AES-256-GCM encrypts the master key. The resulting blob is stored in the `auth_slots` table alongside your password slot.
4. To unlock, Mini Diarium reads the `.key` file, performs the same ECDH derivation in reverse, and unwraps the master key; your password is never required.

The private key never enters the database. The public key stored in the database cannot unlock the diary. A wrong or tampered key file is rejected by AES-GCM authentication.

### Setting up a key file

1. Open **Preferences → Authentication Methods**
2. Click **Generate Key File**
3. Save the `.key` file somewhere only you control, such as a USB drive, a password manager's secure notes, or an encrypted folder
4. Enter your current password to authorize the registration
5. Give the slot a label (e.g. "USB drive" or "laptop")

From that point you can unlock from the login screen by switching to **Key File** mode and selecting your `.key` file. To remove a key file, open Preferences → Authentication Methods and delete its slot (the last remaining method is always protected from deletion).

> **Backup your key file.** Like an SSH private key, it cannot be regenerated. If you lose both your password slot and all key files, there is no recovery path.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action         | Shortcut           |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Previous Day   | `Ctrl+[`           |
| Next Day       | `Ctrl+]`           |
| Go to Today    | `Ctrl+T`           |
| Go to Date     | `Ctrl+G`           |
| Previous Month | `Ctrl+Shift+[`     |
| Next Month     | `Ctrl+Shift+]`     |
| Preferences    | `Ctrl+,`           |

Statistics, Import, and Export are available via the Diary menu (no default keyboard accelerators).

On macOS, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`.
