# TODO

Open tasks and planned improvements. For full context and implementation notes on the original tasks, see [OPEN_TASKS.md](OPEN_TASKS.md).

TODO entry format:
- `- [ ] **Task title** — concise description with scope, constraints, and any key implementation notes`
- Put items under the appropriate priority section
- Use indented checkbox items only for true sub-tasks or explicit dependencies

## High Priority

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Restore CI diagram content-diff check** — the byte-comparison check in `scripts/verify-diagrams.mjs` was reverted to existence-only because mmdc/d2 produce slightly different SVG bytes depending on version (local vs CI runners differ). The proper fix is to pin identical tool versions in both CI and local dev (e.g. lock `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` in `devDependencies` and `d2` via a specific release download in CI), then re-add the byte comparison. Until then, `diagrams:check` only verifies that all 8 `.svg` files are present.
- [x] **Auto-lock on screen lock (macOS parity)** — Windows implementation is done; add macOS native screen-lock hook so behavior matches across desktop platforms
- [x] **Configurable auto-lock timeout** (2026-03-01) — add a new Preferences setting to enable auto-lock and set the idle timeout in seconds; enforce a valid range of `1` to `999` seconds and lock the diary automatically when the threshold is reached
- [x] **Expanded rich text editor support** (2026-02-28) — extend the built-in editor with more complete rich text capabilities beyond the current formatting set; define the supported feature set, keep the UX consistent with local-first editing, and ensure stored HTML remains compatible with import/export flows
- [x] **Hide advanced rich-text controls behind a setting** (2026-03-01) — add a preference to keep the default editor toolbar minimal and reveal the extra formatting controls (for example underline, strikethrough, blockquote, inline code, horizontal rule, and heading picker) only when the user opts in; define the default state, make sure the setting only affects toolbar visibility and not rendering of existing content, and keep import/export behavior unchanged
- [ ] **i18n framework** — detect OS locale, set up translation files (`en.json`, `es.json`), add `t()` helper
  - [ ] **Translate all UI text** — replace hardcoded strings with translation keys (~145 keys); depends on i18n framework above
- [ ] **Frontend test coverage** — auth screens (`PasswordPrompt.tsx`, `PasswordCreation.tsx`), Calendar, and all overlays (GoToDateOverlay, PreferencesOverlay, StatsOverlay, ImportOverlay, ExportOverlay) have zero test coverage; add Vitest + @solidjs/testing-library tests for each; use existing pattern from `TitleEditor.test.tsx` and `WordCount.test.tsx`
- [ ] **`screen_lock.rs` unit tests** — the Windows session-lock hook is untested because it calls Win32 APIs directly; extract `trigger_auto_lock` and test it with a mock `DiaryState`; requires Win32 API mocking strategy.

## Low Priority / Future

- [ ] **PDF export** — convert diary entries to PDF (A4); likely via Tauri webview printing
- [ ] **Text input extension point** — create a plugin/extension interface for alternative entry methods so official and user plugins can provide text input flows such as dictation, LLM-assisted drafting, and other future capture modes; define capability boundaries, permission model, and how plugins hand content into the editor without weakening the app’s privacy guarantees
- [ ] **Statistics extension point** — add a plugin/extension interface for journal statistics so official and user plugins can calculate custom metrics and surface them in the statistics UI; define the data contract, execution/sandbox constraints, and how custom statistics are registered and rendered without weakening the app’s privacy-first local-only model
- [ ] **Downgrade import path logging** — `commands/import.rs` logs the import file path at `info!` level (line 52 and other locations), leaking the full filesystem path in dev logs; downgrade all path logs to `debug!` level for all import functions
- [ ] **`DiaryEntry` clone efficiency** — `DiaryEntry` in `db/queries.rs` derives `Clone` and can be heap-copied across import/export flows; pass references where possible to reduce allocations when processing thousands of entries; audit current command and export call sites
- [ ] **Document keypair hex in JS heap** — `generate_keypair` returns `KeypairFiles` with `private_key_hex` as plain JSON so the frontend can write it to a file; add a comment on the struct in `auth/mod.rs` or `auth/keypair.rs` noting this is an accepted design tradeoff and that the private key briefly exists in the JS heap before the file is written
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — only 5 ARIA labels exist (Calendar nav buttons, EditorToolbar buttons); missing ARIA on overlays, form inputs, dialogs, focus trapping, and keyboard calendar navigation; add color contrast testing and screen reader testing (NVDA / VoiceOver)
- [ ] **Mobile version** — Tauri v2 supports iOS and Android targets; evaluate porting the app to mobile: adapt the SolidJS UI for touch (larger tap targets, bottom navigation, swipe gestures for day navigation), handle mobile file-system sandboxing for the diary DB location, and assess whether the Argon2id parameters need tuning for mobile CPU/memory constraints
- [ ] **Website SEO/GEO follow-up backlog** — remaining implementation items from the 2026 website SEO/GEO pass
  - [ ] **Optimize demo media** — replace the 4.7 MB `website/assets/demo.gif` with a lightweight preview strategy (e.g. poster image + optional MP4/WebM playback) to reduce transfer size and improve performance signals
  - [ ] **Canonical host redirect** — enforce one canonical host (`mini-diarium.com` vs `www`) with explicit 301 behavior in deployment/edge config and keep `<link rel="canonical">` aligned
  - [ ] **Email no-JS fallback** — make the contact email actionable without JavaScript (server-rendered `mailto:`), keeping optional obfuscation/enhancement on top
  - [ ] **Release freshness ops** — document and automate post-release discovery flow (Search Console URL inspection/request indexing and optional IndexNow ping) for high-cadence releases
